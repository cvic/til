# TIL

> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. These are mostly things I learn by doing Clojure code monkeying.

_1 TIL and counting..._

## Usage

The `.vimrc` file for this project contains a function `CountTILs` that can
be invoked with `<leader>c`. This will do a substitution count of the
current number of TILs and display the result in the command tray.

## About

I shamelessly stole this idea from
[thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).
